# Coin Toss
Visualization of various beta distributions as priors and their long-term effects on posteriors in a coin toss game.

# Pendulum Simulation
Simulation of pendulum scenario w/ uniform, Gaussian prior and differing variances through 3 realizations. Goal: visualize how different priors and observational datas influence posterior.

# K-Means
Explores if initialized cluster centers can approach the "ideal" in a K-Means clustering when data is initialized overlapping vs. non-overlapping.

# GMM
Explores KMeans vs. Expectation Maximization in finding a suitable model for GMMs.
# Pop-Art
Making Mike Tyson pop-art using K-Means clustering.
